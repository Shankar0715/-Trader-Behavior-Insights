Market Sentiment & Trader Behavior Analysis
Overview
This project explores the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs. Greed) and trader performance using two datasets:

Fear & Greed Index – capturing the emotional sentiment of the market

Historical Trader Data – detailing real trades made by traders on the Hyperliquid platform

The objective is to uncover patterns in trading behavior based on sentiment and deliver insights to inform smarter trading strategies.
